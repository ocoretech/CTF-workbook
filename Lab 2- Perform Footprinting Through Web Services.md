## **Task 1: Find the Company’s Domains and Sub-domains using Netcraft**

Domains and sub-domains are part of critical network infrastructure for any organization. A company's top-level domains (TLDs) and sub-domains can provide much useful information.

We will extract the company’s domains and sub-domains using the Netcraft web service.

Steps:

1. Launch Mozilla Firefox and type https://www.netcraft.com in the search bar and press enter.

2. Netcraft page appears, click on menu icon from the top-right corner of the page and navigate to the Resources -> Tools -> Site Report.

3. The What’s that site running? page appears. To extract information associated with the organizational website, type the target website's URL i.e. (www.eccouncil.org) in the text field, and then click the Look up button.

4. The page appears, containing information related to Background, Network, Hosting History, etc.

5. In the Network section, click on the website link in the Domain field to view the subdomains.

6. The result will display subdomains of the target website along with netblock and operating system information. 

Note: The attackers can use this collected list of subdomains to perform web application attacks on the target organization.

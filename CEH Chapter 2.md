## **Chapter 2: Footprinting**

### **Page 5**

* The information gathered in this step helps in uncovering vulnerabilities existing in the target network and in identifying different ways of exploiting these vulnerabilities.

### **Page 6**

* Performing passive footprinting is technically difficult, as active traffic is not sent to the target organization from a host or anonymous hosts or services over the internet.

Put this particular point in backend note.
* Good to learn more about stuff (employees) of a company
through them you can learn a lot more and gain a lot more access
e.g. contact them through social media and start a conversation
e.g. join a conference that you see the person is attending on LinkedIn and meet him.

* theHarvester
    * a tool for gathering subdomain names, e-mail addresses, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources.


### **Page 17**

* Disable the geo-tagging functionality on cameras to prevent geolocation tracking.
* Train employees to thwart social engineering techniques and attacks.


### **Page 18**

*  Search engines use automated software, i.e., crawlers, to continuously scan active websites and add the retrieved results in the search engine index that is further stored in a massive database.


### **Page 19**

*  Attackers can use the Google Hacking Database (GHDB), a database of queries, to identify sensitive data.


### **Page 25**

* You can upload an image or paste the URL of the image in the reverse image search engine. The search engine verifies the search engine index and displays all the online locations of the image in the search results page.


### **Page 26**

*  The video content obtained from video search engines is of high value, as it can be used for gathering information about the target.


### **Page 27**

* Meta search engines also include a functionality whereby identical search results are filtered out so that if the user searches the same query again, then it will not display the same results twice. 

* Meta search engines also provide privacy to the search engine user by hiding the user’s IP address.


Backend Note: 
*  These search engines do not have their own search indexes; instead, they take the inputs from the users and simultaneously send out the queries to the third-party search engines to obtain the results.

*  Although FTP servers are usually protected with passwords, many servers are left unsecured and can be accessed directly through web browsers.

* Competitive intelligence gathering is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, verifying, and using information about your competitors from resources such as the Internet.

### **Page 36**

* Whois footprinting focuses on how to perform a Whois lookup, analyze the Whois lookup results, and find IP geolocation information.

### **Page 39**

* Using the information obtained from IP geolocation, an attacker may attempt to gather more information about a target with the help of social engineering, surveillance, and non-technical attacks such as dumpster diving, hoaxing, or acting as a technical expert.

* With the help of the information obtained, an attacker can also set up a compromised web server near the victim’s location, and if the exact location of the victim is detected, the attacker can perform malicious activities and infect the victim with malware designed for that specific area.

### **Page 40**

* When an attacker queries a DNS server using a DNS interrogation tool, the server responds with a record structure that contains information about the target DNS.


### **Page 41**

* DNS lookup is used to find the IP addresses for a given domain name, and a reverse DNS operation is performed to obtain the domain name of a given IP address.
*  Attackers perform a reverse DNS lookup on the IP range to locate a DNS PTR record for such IP addresses.


### **Page 42**

* Email tracking tools allow an attacker to collect information such as IP addresses, mail servers, and service providers involved in sending the email.


### **Page 43**

* The attacker can trace and collect all this information by performing a detailed analysis of the complete email header.


### **Page 48**

* Attackers use Burp Suite, Zaproxy, Wappalyzer, CentralOps, Website Informer, etc. to view headers that provide the information. 
* An attacker can build a detailed map of a website's structure and architecture without triggering the IDS.


### **Page 49**

* User-Directed Spidering:
  
  * The incoming and outgoing traffic of the target website is monitored and analyzed by tools that include features of both a web spider and an intercepting proxy.
  * Attackers use tools such as Burp Suite and WebScarab to perform user-directed spidering.


### **Page 55**

* Website mirroring is the process of creating a replica or clone of the original website.

### **Page 59**

* Assists attackers in creating a map of the target network.
* Attacker can find the range of IP addresses using ARIN whois database search tool.


### **Page 62**

* The Traceroute utility can detail the path through which IP packets travel between two systems.

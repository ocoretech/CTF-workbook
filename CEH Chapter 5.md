* The quantitative model of the system ensures repeatable and accurate measurement while enabling users to view the underlying vulnerability characteristics that were used to generate the scores.

CVSS assessment consists of the following three metrics for measuring vulnerabilities:

1. Base Metric: represents the inherent qualities of a vulnerability. 

2. Temporal Metric: represents the features that continue to change during the lifetime of the vulnerability.

3. Environmental Metric: represents vulnerabilities that are based on a particular environment or implementation.

* CVE IDs provide a baseline for evaluating the coverage of tools and services so that users can determine which tools are most effective and appropriate for their organizationâ€™s needs.

* The NVD performs an analysis on CVEs that have been published to the CVE Dictionary. 

* NVD staff are tasked with the analysis of CVEs by aggregating data points from the description, references supplied, and any supplemental data that are publicly available.

* The NVD does not actively perform vulnerability testing; it relies on vendors, third party security researchers, and vulnerability coordinators to provide information. 


### **Page 13**

* CWE is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

* It is sponsored by the National Cybersecurity FFRDC, which is owned by The MITRE Corporation, with support from US-CERT and the National Cyber Security Division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.     

* It has an advanced search technique where attackers can search and view weaknesses based on research concepts, development concepts, and architectural concepts.

     Components of Vulnerability Assessment Report


### **Page 19**

* Gives immediate, global visibility into where IT systems might be vulnerable to the latest Internet threats and how to protect them. 

* It helps to continuously identify threats and monitor unexpected changes in a network before they turn into breaches.

Features of Qualys Vulnerability Management are:

1. Agent-based detection
2. Constant monitoring and alerts
3. Comprehensive coverage and visibility
4. Discover forgotten devices and organize the host assets
5. Scan for vulnerabilities everywhere, accurately and efficiently

* This flaw allows an attacker to retrieve private memory of an application that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL library.

* POODLE attack against SSL
    
    * This vulnerability lets an attacker eavesdrop on communication encrypted using SSL.


### **Page 34**

* This vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the Secure Sockets Layer Version 2 (SSLv2) implementation, and it allows captured TLS traffic to by decrypted.


### **Page 35** 

* Automated penetration testing or Vulnerability Scanning is an automated process of detecting vulnerabilities performed with penetration testing tools.


### **Page 37**

* The purpose of Metasploit is to help users identify where they are most likely to face attacks by hackers and proactively mend those weaknesses before exploitation by hackers. 

Metasploit Shell Types:

1. Bind Shell:  
    
    * The target machine opens up a listener on the victim machine, and then the attacker connects to the listener to get a remote shell. This type of shell is risky because anyone can connect to the shell and run the command.


2. Reverse Shell:

    *  A reverse shell starts a connection with the attacker's machine, in this case, the attacker's machine is the one that is opening a local port and listening for a connection.


## **Task 1:** Gather Employees Information from LinkedIn using theHarvester

LinkedIn contains personal information such as name, position, organization name, current location, educational qualifications, etc. 

Gather information about the employees of a target organization that is available on LinkedIn using theHarvester tool. 

Steps:

1. Turn on Kali Linux virtual machine. Open the terminal at the top left corner of the desktop.

2. Type theHarvester -d eccouncil -l 200 -b linkedin and press Enter to see 200 results of EC-Council from the LinkedIn source.

3. In this command, -d specifies the domain or company name to search (here, eccouncil), -l specifies the number of results to be retrieved, and -b specifies the data source as LinkedIn.

4. Scroll down to view the list of employees along with their job roles in EC-Council. This information from LinkedIn can help attackers in performing social engineering or phishing attacks.

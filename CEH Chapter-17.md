Agent Smith Attack

* An Agent smith attack is carried out by persuading the victim to install a malicious app designed and published by an attacker.

* The malicious app replaces legitimate apps, such as WhatsApp, SHAREit, and MX Player.


Simjacker

* Simjacker is a vulnerability associated with a SIM card's S@T browser (SIMalliance Toolbox Browser), a pre-installed software incorporated in SIM cards to provide a set of instructions.


OTP Hijacking

* One-time passwords (OTPs) are sent by a server via SMS, an authenticator app, or an email for the secure authentication of users.

* The attacker succeeds in OTP hijacking by initially stealing the victim's PII data by bribing or tricking mobile store sellers or exploiting the reuse of the number for different customers.

OTP Hijacking Countermeasures:

1. Periodically update software and operating systems (OSes) to the current version.
2. Access only Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)-certified sites.
3. Enable SIM locking via a PIN to avoid unauthorized SIM access.
4. Disable the display of sensitive notifications on the lock screen.
5. Avoid forwarding OTPs to others and avoid typing the OTP on the browser while on call. 
6. Avoid applications that authenticate themselves via SMS.


Camera/Microphone Capture Attacks

* Camfecting Attack

    * In this attack, the attacker gains access to the camera of a target's computer or mobile device.

    * Attacker infects the target device with a remote access Trojan (RAT) and compromises it to access the victim's camera and microphone. 

    * An attacker can also disable the camera light to avoid detection.


* Android Camera Hijack

    * An attacker can exploit Android's multiple security bypass vulnerabilities to circumvent the required permissions and gain access to the victim's camera and microphone. 

    These applications need the victim to provide permissions such as
     
     * android.permission.CAMERA 
     * android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO 
     * android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
     * android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION

    This allows attackers to perform activities such as capturing photos, recording videos and voice calls, and accessing stored photos.

Phishing Attacks

* Sends an email containing a malicious link and tricking the user into clicking it.

* Clicking the link will redirect the user to a fake website that appears similar to the legitimate website.

* The website prompts the user to enter sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, bank account details etc, and diverts the data to the attacker.

Web Server Pasword Cracking Attacks

* Some password cracking techniques are as follows:

**1. Guessing:** most common method in which attacker guesses possible passwords either manually or automated provided with dictionaries.


**2. Dictionary attack:** uses a predefined file containing various combinations of words, and an automated program enters these words one at a time to check if any of them are the password.


**3. Brute-force attack:**  all possible character combinations are tested.


**4. Hybrid attack:** more powerful than the other techniques because it uses both a dictionary attack and brute-force attack.

Web Application Attacks

* Parameter/Form Tampering:  the attacker manipulates the parameters exchanged between the client and server to modify application data


* Cookie Tampering: occur when a cookie is sent from the client side to the server. Different tools help in modyfying persistent and non-persistent cookies.

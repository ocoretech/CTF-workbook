* Reflector Antennas
    
    Reflector antennas are used to concentrate EM energy that is radiated or received at a focal point.

* Yagi Antenna

    Is a unidirectional antenna commonly used in communications at a frequency band of 10 MHz. This antenna has a high gain and low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio for radio signals.

WI-FI Security Auditing Tools

* Cisco Adaptive Wireless IPS

    * Cisco Adaptive Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) offers     advanced network security for dedicated monitoring and detection of wireless network anomalies. 

    * Integrated with the Cisco Unified Wireless Network, this solution delivers integrated visibility and control across the network.
